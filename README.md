# graphea
Enterprise Architecture as a labled property graph.
## Why Graphea?
- Reuse existing investment into Graph Analytics by hosting your Enterprise Architecture using the same Graph Database
- Run queries and Analytics that include or refers to Enterprise Architecture artefacts - for example, link Cases with Policies
- Use the maximum power of query languages like Cypher of Gremlin, and associated graph analytics libraries, to verify consistency and 
- Use maximum power of Large Language Models to populate your Enterprise Architecture
- Extend Enterprise Architecture into Business Modelling using Object Management Group standards
## What can you get from the site
- High level definitions
- Constraints to act as a schema (Graph Databases are schema-optionial)
- Guidelines on identifying the artefacts
- Queries for consistency
## What you may need
- Training
- Assistance in populating the database from documents, PowerPoints, Visio diagrams etc
## What may be available soon
- ArchiMate presentation. ArchiMate is proprietarily licensed, so anything to do with ArchiMate has to wait for GraphEA achieving significant momentum, or for a client that wants to sponsor it
